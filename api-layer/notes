XrAction, XrActionSet handles will be only virtual, not backed by runtime handles.
    can't call downchain on them, no "actualHandle"
    actual XrActionSet, XrAction handles held by SessionInfo for purposes of Attach and Sync etc
I was able to make more than 9800 XrPaths on Oculus' RT
I was able to make 9998 XrActions on Oculus' RT

shared_ptr guarantees thread-safe control - deletion, copy, reset, etc.
    https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/atomic-smart-pointers#:~:text=yes%20and%20no.-,Why%3F,will%20be%20deleted%20exactly%20once.
    But OBJECT is still not thread safe.
    all members could be private and all methods take the lock
        init-only const accessors for private members (need to put in ctor) - no locking
        otherwise return-by-value and set functions would lock in order to be atomic / exclusive

Make as many objects simple copies as possible (e.g. RPCConnections is just HANDLEs and DWORDs and void*s)
Identify any objects that may be accessed by multiple threads and why
    unordered_maps mapping handles to tracking state must be locked
        will be appended from negotiation thread
        may have elements removed by overlay service thread
    map of overlay thread ID to overlay state
    list of overlay-owned objects in main process does *not* need to be locked?
        they will only get destroyed in the overlay service thread?  What about 
Why not just lock every API layer call?
    Why?  Only Destroy has to be externally synchronized.  That means we won't be inside an XR command in an app's explicit threads when the handle is Destroyed.
        But we could be in the overlay service thread accessing, say XrSession, when it is Destroyed.

XXX NO REAL ACTION OR ACTIONSET PASSED BACK TO MAIN OR TO OVERLAY

Real ActionSet and Placeholder Actions created at Attach time

OverlaysLayerXrActionSetHandleInfo, add:
    std::vector<XrAction> actions;          // main side only
    std::set<OverlaysLayerVirtualActionHandleInfo::Ptr> localActions;        // overlay side only
    bool mutable = true; // false after attach

OverlaysLayerXrActionHandleInfo, add:
    OverlaysLayerXrActionSetHandleInfo::Ptr parentActionHandle;


So we know that if the overlay suggested for "/interaction_profiles/khr/simple_controller/" binding an action to "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/value", we can query the action we created and bound for those.

A solution must handle:
    multiple suggested bindings
    suggested profile by overlay app does not overlap profiles of main app
    priority of actionsets
    Actions are only valid after SyncActions 
    Action state is fixed between SyncActions
    ActionSet/Action is immutable after Attach
    ActionState may be an aggregation of multiple input sources, e.g. XrBool32 is OR of all valid sources
    behavior of main must not change appreciably

Applications "may" suggest interaction profile bindings
    SuggestInteractionProfileBindings provides a tuple {interaction_profile path, binding path, action}
        EnumerateBoundSourcesForAction provides 0 or more source binding paths for an action
            source binding paths can be changed into strings
            each can be compared against other interaction profile binding path strings
    if bindings aren't suggested, input can't be routed because runtime has no idea what actions mean what
    So, for a given action, IF AN INTERACTION PROFILE BINDING HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, one may reverse-lookup 0 or more interaction profile binding paths for the action.
        e.g. in hello_xr, grabAction for interaction profiles is the following bindings:
            "/interaction_profiles/khr/simple_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/select/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/select/click"
            "/interaction_profiles/oculus/touch_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/value"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/value"
            "/interaction_profiles/htc/vive_controller"
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/click"
            "/interaction_profiles/microsoft/motion_controller" (bindings same as htc/vive_controller)
                "/user/hand/left/input/squeeze/click"
                "/user/hand/right/input/squeeze/click"
        The list of Paths for a given action can be refined further by using the current interaction profile name
            e.g. if one knows the interaction profile is oculus/touch_controller, then one can know that grabAction is {left,right}/input/squeeze/value
            if one does not know the interaction profile, then what?
                Just check all of them?
        further a subactionpath might disambiguate fully mapping an action to a binding
        if overlay suggests "select/click" for XrAction bar and main suggests "select/click" for XrAction foo, xrGetActionStateBoolean on bar could return the same as for foo.
    However, an app might suggest only khr/simple_controller and might not suggest any others
        what if overlay suggests "khr/simple_controller" "select/click" for XrAction bar, and main suggests "oculus/touch_controller" "squeeze/value" for XrAction foo.
            Should OverlaysLayer be responsible for converting input profiles?
                xrGetCurrentInteractionProfile would need to translate from oculus/touch_controller to khr/simplecontroller
                xrGetActionStateBoolean would need to know {"oculus/touch_controller","squeeze/value"} can be reasonably approximated by {"khr/simple_controller","select/click"}
                Overlay Layer would need a mapping with entries from {main profile, main binding} to {overlay profile, overlay binding}
                if main suggests bindings in a profile that Overlay Layer doesn't know, probably have to punt for now.
                Maybe punt in general if main's selected interaction profile is not suggested at all by overlay.
    overlay XrActions may not have the same types as main XrActions for the same bindings.
        May be able to do conversions one direction but not the other..
        punt here too if they don't match?
    An overlay app may suggest bindings for a profile that don't 100% overlap with 100% of main app's bindings
        also punt, I guess.  Some overlay app Actions won't then receive input.
    Finally, an XrAction may be bound to multiple input paths.  See 11.5.1 - "Resolving a single action bound to multiple inputs or outputs" for how that's resolved
    XrAction -> look up in suggested interaction bindings, refine by current interaction profile, results in >= 0 profile paths
